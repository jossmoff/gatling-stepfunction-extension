Now we can successfully start an execution, what about checking it has succesfully executed? 

## Check Succeeds
The most straight forward check is to ensure that the stepfunction has successfully executed. You can do that using the following:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Standard">
		```scala
	    // Start the exectuion
		.pause(someAmmountOfTime)
        .exec(
            sfn("Check item-batch-processor execution completion").checkSucceeded
        )
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Express (sync)">
	    <Card title="Sorry :(" icon="error">
		    Not yet supported. Planned for v1.5.0
	    </Card>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Express (aysnc)">
        <Card title="Sorry :(" icon="error">
		    Not yet supported. Planned for v1.4.0
	    </Card>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Check State Succeeded
Instead of checking that the whole StepFunction has executed, it might be useful only to check up to a certain state. 
To do this, you can supply:

- `stateName`: The name of the state you want to check in the state machine
- `stateType`: The type of state you want to check in the state machine 
<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Standard">
		```scala
	    // Start the exectuion
		.pause(someAmmountOfTime)
        .exec(
            sfn("Check item-batch-processor execution completion").checkStateSucceeded
            .stateName("NameOfStateSucceeded")
            .stateType(LAMBDA_FUNCTION_SUCCEEDED)
        )
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Express (sync)">
	    <Card title="Sorry :(" icon="error">
		    Not yet supported. Planned for v1.5.0
	    </Card>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Express (aysnc)">
        <Card title="Sorry :(" icon="error">
		    Not yet supported. Planned for v1.4.0
	    </Card>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
