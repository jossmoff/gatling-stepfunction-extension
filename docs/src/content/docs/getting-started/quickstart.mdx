## Picking the Right Language

Currently only Scala is supported, however when wider language support is added, we will echo Gatling's [language recomendations](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/tutorials/quickstart/#picking-the-right-language):

> When picking a language for using Gatling, we recommend the following rule:
>
>    - if your target Gatling users are Scala developers, use Scala
>    - if they are Kotlin developers, use Kotlin
>    - otherwise, use Java

## Installation
If you need detailed instructions on how to add this project to your own application using your favorite build tool, please refer to the [Installation](../installation/) section in this documentation.

## Test Case - `item-batch-processor`
This is a fake example of a StepFunction called the `item-batch-processor` that the VeryRealCompany use in their business. The company has made it integral that this component be performance tested as it must always be able to finish executing within a minute for a **really good reason**. The average load is about 10 executions a second.

### Architecture

The `item-batch-processor` performs some batch processing on some internal data items using the Map state. Each item undergoes individual processing based on some logic which is done by a lambda. If an item requires additional manual processing, it will be flagged and placed into a manual processing queue for further human intervention. That might look something like this: 

![A stepfunction that processes some items](../../../assets/item-batch-processor.svg)

### Scenario

From the introduction we could deduce the following load scenario:

- Start the StepFunction executing with realistic data for processing
- Check that the StepFunction finished executing after 60 seconds.


### Simulation

Here would be an example of what we would need to performance test this component:

```scala
package simulation

import dev.joss.gatling.sfn.Predef._
import dev.joss.gatling.sfn.protocol.{SfnProtocol, SfnProtocolBuilder}
import io.gatling.core.Predef._
import io.gatling.core.scenario.Simulation
import io.gatling.core.structure.{PopulationBuilder, ScenarioBuilder}
import software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region
import software.amazon.awssdk.auth.credentials.{
  AwsSessionCredentials,
  StaticCredentialsProvider
}
import software.amazon.awssdk.http.apache.ApacheHttpClient
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.sfn.SfnClient
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.sfn.model.HistoryEventType.WAIT_STATE_EXITED

import java.net.URI
import scala.concurrent.duration.DurationInt
import scala.language.postfixOps
class ExampleSimulation extends Simulation {
  var sfnClient: SfnClient = SfnClient
    .builder()
    .region(Region.EU_WEST_1)
    .build()

  private var sfnProtocol: SfnProtocolBuilder = sfn.client(sfnClient)

  private var sfnArn =
    "arn:aws:states:eu-west-1:000000000000:stateMachine:item-batch-processor"

  private val scn: ScenarioBuilder = scenario("Check item-batch-processor execution")
    .exec(
      sfn("Start item-batch-processor Execution").startExecution
        .arn(sfnArn)
        .payload("{[\"items\": [...]]}")
    )
    .pause(60.seconds)
    .exec(
      sfn("Check item-batch-processor execution completion").checkSucceeded
    )

  private val requests: PopulationBuilder = scn.inject {
    constantUsersPerSec(10) during (60 seconds)
  }
  setUp(requests).protocols(sfnProtocol)

}

```

What does this all mean?

1. Create a StepFunction client that will be used to make the requests.
2. Create the `SfnProtocol` which will tell Gatling Simulation to make StepFunction executions.
3. Specify the ARN for the StepFunction we want under load.
4. Create the scenario:
    1. Use `startExecution` to start an execution with a given ARN and payload.
    2. Wait the maximum ammount of time using `pause` to allow for the executions to complete.
    3. Check the status of an execution by using `checkSucceeded` .
5. Finish setting up the scenario by defining the `PopulationBuilder` and calling `setUp`.
